deluge-copycompleted
====================

This plugin for [Deluge][1] copies downloaded files to another location.

It can only be configured via the web interface (or by hand); there is no GTK
UI for this plugin.

It works fine for me, but if there are any issues, feel free to drop me an
email at sam@edgylogic.com, or better yet, fork, fix, and I'll pull your
changes.
