deluge-copycompleted
====================

This plugin for [Deluge][1] copies downloaded files to another location.

A Move To option is also included that avoids the network speed drop
associated with using Move Storage in Deluge.

It can only be configured via the web or gtk interface.

It works fine for me, but if there are any issues, feel free to drop me an
email at sam@edgylogic.com, or better yet, fork, fix, and I'll pull your
changes.
